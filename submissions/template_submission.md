Project Title
TicketSwap 

Project Description
During the hackathon, we developed TicketSwap, an online platform designed to facilitate the resale of train tickets between buyers and sellers. Our website acts as a mediator between passengers who need to urgently sell their train tickets and those who are looking to buy last-minute tickets. Sellers, instead of canceling and receiving minimal refunds from train companies, can sell their tickets at 90% of the ticket value on our platform. Buyers can purchase these tickets at a slight premium—around 20% above the regular price—which is still more cost-effective than other options like last-minute fares. Our platform takes a small commission from both buyers and sellers, ensuring a fair and efficient system for both parties.

Inspiration behind the Project
The idea for TicketSwap came from the frustration that passengers often face when they need to cancel their train tickets last minute and receive only a minimal refund. Similarly, passengers who need tickets urgently often have to pay high prices for last-minute bookings. We wanted to create a solution that benefits both parties: allowing sellers to recoup a higher percentage of their ticket costs, and buyers to get tickets at a more affordable price. TicketSwap bridges this gap, creating a win-win scenario for both sides while providing a seamless platform for transactions.

Tech Stack
We used the following technologies to build TicketSwap:

Frontend: React.js for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for server-side operations, including ticket management and transaction handling.
Database: MongoDB to store user profiles, ticket details, and transaction records.
Payment Integration: Stripe API to handle secure payments and commissions.
Notifications: Firebase for real-time notifications, including ticket availability and purchase confirmations.
Usage of Appwrite
Appwrite was used to handle the following key features:

Authentication: Secure user authentication for both buyers and sellers.
Database: Managing user information, ticket listings, and transaction history in a secure manner.
Real-time Communication: Enabling instant updates for ticket status changes and notifications for both buyers and sellers.

Anything Else You Want To Share With Us?
TicketSwap aims to revolutionize the way last-minute train ticket cancellations and urgent bookings are handled. By offering a platform where buyers and sellers can transact fairly and efficiently, we’re reducing the financial burden on both parties. Our platform also provides a convenient, secure, and easy-to-use interface for handling payments and ticket exchanges. We plan to scale the project by integrating more transportation options and expanding our platform to support bus and flight tickets in the future.
